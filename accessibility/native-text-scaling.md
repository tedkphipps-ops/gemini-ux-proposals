# Proposal: Native UI Text Scaling & Zoom Accessibility Controls

## Executive Summary
This proposal addresses a critical accessibility feature gap within the Gemini chat interface. Currently, users with low vision or visual impairments must rely entirely on browser-wide zoom settings to read chat outputs. This project proposes integrating native text scaling and high-contrast font adjustments directly inside the Gemini interface to improve usability for visually impaired individuals.

## The Problem
Forcing visualy impaired users to rely on standard browser zoom (`Ctrl` + `+`) causes severe user interface distortion and physical strain.
* **Ergonomic Strain & Posture Disruption:** Due to the lack of independent font scaling within individual workspace frames or sidebars, visually impaired users are forced to physically lean forward to read text outputs. This causes sustained poor posture and physical fatigue during long technical sessions.
* **Cross-Platform Scaling Failures:** Universal browser zoom commands often scale the main webpage containers while completely failing to adjust the font sizes inside adjacent conversational AI frames or embedded chat tools, leaving the critical text unreadable.
* **Cognitive Fatigue:** Users are forced to constantly scroll horizontally and vertically just to read a single response, disrupting the conversational flow and causing unnecessary physical repetition.

## Proposed Solution: In-App Accessibility Controls
Implement a dedicated UI accessibility menu directly within the Gemini interface, offering independent text-scaling controls.

1. **Independent Text Resizing:** A quick-access button (e.g., `A+` / `A-`) that increases or decreases the text size of the chat bubbles and system outputs *without* altering the layout of the sidebars or main menus.
2. **Dynamic Reflow:** Ensure that when font sizes are increased, the text automatically wraps perfectly within the existing bubble constraints, completely eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling.
3. **Contrast Toggles:** High-contrast text options specifically designed for readability against dark or light backgrounds.

## Real-World Value
* **True Universal Design:** Aligns the platform with modern Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
* **Enhanced Usability:** Empowers users with visual impairments to maintain an optimal, distraction-free workspace across multiple active tabs.
